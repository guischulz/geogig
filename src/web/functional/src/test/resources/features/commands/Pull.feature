@Commands @Pull
Feature: Pull
  The pull command allows a user to merge a remote branch into a local one and is supported through the "/repos/{repository}/pull" endpoint
  The command must be executed using the HTTP GET method

  @Status405
  Scenario: Verify wrong HTTP method issues 405 "Method not allowed"
    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
     When I call "PUT /repos/repo1/pull"
     Then the response status should be '405'
      And the response allowed methods should be "GET"
      
  @Status404
  Scenario: Pull outside of a repository issues 404 "Not found"
    Given There is an empty multirepo server
     When I call "GET /repos/repo1/pull"
     Then the response status should be '404'
      And the response ContentType should be "application/xml"
      And the xpath "/response/success/text()" equals "false"
      And the xpath "/response/error/text()" equals "Repository not found."
