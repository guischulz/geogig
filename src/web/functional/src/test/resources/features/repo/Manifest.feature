    Given There is an empty repository named repo1
     When I call "PUT /repos/repo1/repo/manifest"
     Then the response status should be '405'
      And the response allowed methods should be "GET"

      And the response body should contain "HEAD refs/heads/master {@ObjectId|repo1|master}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/master {@ObjectId|repo1|master}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/branch1 {@ObjectId|repo1|branch1}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/branch2 {@ObjectId|repo1|branch2}"
      
  Scenario: Manifest also lists remote branches when the remotes parameter is specified
    Given There is a default multirepo server with remotes

      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/master {@ObjectId|repo2|master}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/branch1 {@ObjectId|repo2|branch1}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/heads/branch2 {@ObjectId|repo2|branch2}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/remotes/origin/HEAD {@ObjectId|repo1|master}"
      And the response body should contain "refs/remotes/origin/master {@ObjectId|repo1|master}"
